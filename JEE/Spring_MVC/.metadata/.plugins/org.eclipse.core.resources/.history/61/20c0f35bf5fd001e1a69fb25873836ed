	 * Dependency : Project Lombok
	Lombok is a Java library that provides annotations to simplify Java 
	development by automating the generation of boilerplate code. Key features
	include automatic generation of getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and 
	toString methods, as well as a facility for automatic resource management.
	 It aims to reduce the amount of manual coding, thereby streamlining 
	 the codebase and reducing potential for errors.
